# 20240327 Project

***Would you be available next week for a project/technical interview? The structure of these is:***

- ***Share a past project (git repo, etc.) 48+ hours in advance of the interview***
- ***Join a 60 mn call where you talk me through the context of the project, and make a small extension on the code base. Most candidates come with an extension planned, I find this helps ensure we use the time well.***

***If possible, can you share a project where data visualization was an important component? This role would involve working in tools like Tableau/QuickSite and scripting in SQL and Python.***

import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

# 1. Read the CSV file
file_path = '/Users/Apple/Downloads/OGDSurvey.csv'  # Adjust to your file path
data = pd.read_csv(file_path, encoding='Big5')

# 2. Establish a connection to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')  # Use an in-memory database

# 3. Use the DataFrame's to_sql method to directly insert the data into the SQLite database
data.to_sql('survey_data', conn, if_exists='replace', index=False)

# 4. Use pandas to query the database
query = "SELECT * FROM survey_data"
df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)

# 5. Save the query results to a CSV
save_path = '/Users/Apple/Desktop/my_dataframe.csv'  # Adjust to the actual save path
df.to_csv(save_path, index=False, encoding='utf_8_sig')

print(f'Query results have been saved to: {save_path}')

# 6. Close the database connection
conn.close()
